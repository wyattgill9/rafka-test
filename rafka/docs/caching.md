# Rafka Caching Strategy

## Distributed Cache with Consistent Hashing

Rafka implements a highly scalable distributed caching system using consistent hashing. This approach ensures optimal data distribution and minimal redistribution when scaling.

### Key Features

1. **Consistent Hashing Ring**
   - Even distribution of data across nodes
   - Minimal data movement during scaling
   - O(1) lookup time for cache locations

2. **Local Cache Management**
   - Each broker maintains its own local cache
   - TTL-based cache invalidation
   - Memory-efficient storage using zero-copy where possible

3. **Replication**
   - Configurable replication factor
   - Automatic failover
   - Eventually consistent updates

### Scaling Characteristics

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add nodes with minimal redistribution
- **Load Distribution**: Automatic load balancing across nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continued operation during node failures

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Zero-Copy Cache Access**
   - Direct memory access for cache entries
   - Minimal serialization overhead

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Grouped cache updates
   - Pipeline cache retrievals

3. **Smart Routing**
   - Direct routing to cache owners
   - Minimal network hops

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Cache hit/miss rates
- Memory usage per node
- Rebalancing metrics
- Health checks
