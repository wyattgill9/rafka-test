# Rafka Architecture

## Overview
Rafka is a high-performance, stateless message broker system designed for scalability and resilience. Unlike traditional message brokers, Rafka operates without maintaining persistent state, relying instead on runtime discovery and dynamic coordination.

## Key Components

### Stateless Broker
- Dynamic message routing based on runtime information
- No persistent metadata storage
- Zero-copy message passing using RDMA when available
- Parallel message processing using optimized thread pools

### Dynamic Partitioning
- Runtime partition assignment
- Consistent hashing for message distribution
- No persistent partition tables

### Consumer Groups
- Dynamic consumer group management
- Stateless offset tracking
- External offset storage support

### Network Layer
- P2P communication between brokers
- Zero-copy networking
- RDMA support for high-performance scenarios

## Performance Optimizations
1. Zero-copy message passing
2. RDMA support for high-speed networks
3. Parallel message processing
4. Batched operations
5. Dynamic load balancing

## Scaling
The system scales horizontally by adding more broker nodes. No coordination is required as all state is discovered at runtime.
